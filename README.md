**Background on the FOMC**

The [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) meets eight times annually to make pivotal decisions regarding U.S. monetary policy. The committee's mission centers on the Federal Reserve's dual mandate: fostering maximum employment and maintaining price stability (i.e., managing inflation).

The FOMC meeting statement serves as one of the Federal Reserve's principal channels for formal communication. It contains critical insights into interest rate decisions, economic outlook assessments, inflation perspectives, and forward guidance. This information is instrumental for businesses, investors, and the public in understanding and adapting to monetary policy directions.
